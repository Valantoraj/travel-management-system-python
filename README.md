# travel-management-system-python
It is a project that had been completed by us,a team of 3 under the guidance of our 
professor Dr.K.Anitha Kumari.It is a travel management application that was built on python with 
tkinter (gui library in python) and sqlite3 as database.It is a complete travel management application 
with realtime datas of tourist places across India along with real-time train,hotel and location datas 
which was effectively incorpated using api requests to an endpoint that provides data from servers.It 
also incorpates user login and sign up features.It also includes OTP and booking details delivery via 
gmail using SMTP library.It advantages of booking a complete travel package along with hotels and 
trains in a linear coherent manner rather than the live travel booking applications where we have to 
book everything separately or which have limited packages available.On a whole it is a project of 
around 3500 lines of precision and dedication that solves much of the problems of live travel booking 
applications.
